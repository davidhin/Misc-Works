NNDL Files contains the original files directly downloaded from Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielson. 

DavidNotes contains the code that I reimplemented and commented from the originals. both network.py and network2.py are simple feedforward networks. network2 is a slightly improved version of network.py, implementing various techniques such as regularization, better weight initialization, cross entropy. My notes from chapters 1 to 3 can be found [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPJ49fxVVnt_vafz_CsF0L8hg2oDDW5T/view?usp=sharing](here).

To actually run the neural network, it must be run from NNDL Files because DavidNotes does not contain all the various oter .py files (such as the mnist loader.py, used to load the MNIST data into numpy arrays used by the network).
